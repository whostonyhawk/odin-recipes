            <li>1 1/2 cups peeled and coarsely chopped about two carrots</li>
            <li>2 celery ribs, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>2 fresh bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind, plus grated cheese for garnish</li>
            <li>4 ounces uncooked pastina pasta</li>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring broth, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan or small Dutch oven over high
                ; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
                Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables and 1 cup of broth to a blender.</li>
            <li>Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape.
                Place a clean towel over opening.

                Stir blended carrot mixture back into soup.</li>
            <li>Add thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind.
                Bring to a boil over medium-high.
                Add pasta, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 18 to 20 minutes, adding shredded chicken in the last 3 minutes of cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat.
                Remove and discard thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, and garnish with parsley and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano!</li>
