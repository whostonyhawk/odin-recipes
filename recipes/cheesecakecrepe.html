        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>Ingredients
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 eight ounce package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup  confectioner's sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mixed frozen berries, slightly thawed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the flour, milk, eggs, honey, and salt in a bowl to make a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a nonstick crepe pan over medium heat until the foam disappears.
                Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, and swirl to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of batter.
                Cook until the crepe is no longer runny, about 1 minute; flip and cook the other side for an additional 1 minute.
                Repeat with additional butter and crepe mix, to make 4 crepes.
                Set the crepes aside on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the cream cheese with 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar to make a creamy spread.
                Very gently stir in the berries. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the crepes and roll up.
                Refrigerate until chilled; slice in 1-inch sections to serve!
