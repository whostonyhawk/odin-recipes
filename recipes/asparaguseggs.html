        <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>Ingredients
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>

        <ol>Steps
            <li>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat.

                Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.</li>
